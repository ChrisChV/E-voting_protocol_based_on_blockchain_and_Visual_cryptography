Electronic voting (e-voting) is a latent issue in our current society; Technology advances faster than our democratic system does. The protocols and electronic voting systems must be adapted to the needs of democracy, the most relevant being transparency, verifiability, security and simplicity. At the same time, blockchain technology is changing the way we view data security, thanks to features such as decentralization, immutability, anonymity and auditability. In addition, there are many methods and cryptographic models that help make data transfer safer. 
Visual Cryptography is an effective alternative to encrypt data such as images and text, and can be used to give a layer of security to the system.

Using these technologies can meet some requirements that e-voting needs, in addition to fixing problems, such as the malicious voting platforms, present in other protocols. The proposal of this research is to create a new e-voting protocol with the help of a blockchain model for data security and consensus, Visual Cryptography to improve the privacy of data, and a cryptographic protocol for the process of vote.
